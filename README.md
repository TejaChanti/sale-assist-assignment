# SaleAssist.ai Assignment

Deployed single page on netlify with a dynamic product listing page section built using ReactJs.

## Project Challenges.

- Figma access failed so i created my own design.
- Created products listing page using fakestoreapi.com/products url and used fetch() medthod.
- In navbar section Home, Wishlist, and Cart are dummy routes only products route is active in UI.
- Created category section dynamic and search bar and sort by sections are not working due to no end points for that url.
- But category section works. I used filters method to fetched data to work category section properly.
